# ðŸ’« Aurora Forecast

## ** ABOUT **

In the Aurora Forecast app, users can swiftly identify the current probability of observing an aurora in a specified region. It leverages data from the SWPC NOAA service to provide real-time aurora forecasts based on geographic coordinates.

### Features

- Dynamic Aurora Forecasting: Enables users to search for a specific location and find out the current likelihood of experiencing the aurora phenomena.
- Real-time Updates: Uses the React useEffect hook to fetch the latest aurora data when the component mounts or the geographic coordinates change.
- Coordinate Mapping: Utilizes coordinate manipulation to map longitude and latitude to the data structure used in the SWPC NOAA dataset.
- Visual Representation: Offers a graphical representation of aurora possibilities through a gradient progress bar that portrays the percentage probability of witnessing an aurora.

### The aim of this project

The aim of this project was to learn how to fetch an API using React. Also, because I wanted to learn how to use Redux.

### Some of the challenges I faced through this project

Getting the latitude and longitude of the region searched on Map Box, and finding and extracting the kp from the SWPC NOAA dataset was challenging.

### The technologies I used for this app

- React
- RTK
- Mapbox
- API
- tailwind
- Vercel
